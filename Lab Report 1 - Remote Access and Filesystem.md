## Remote Access - Logging into an account on ieng6

**Install Visual Studio Code**

Go to the website [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Follow all the steps to install onto your device. I didn't have to do this step as I already had VS code on my laptop. After it is installed, open it up. It should look something like this:

**Remote Connecting**
For Windows, the first step is to install [git](https://gitforwindows.org/), then, go to this [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42606837/how-do-i-use-bash-on-windows-from-the-visual-studio-code-integrated-terminal/50527994#50527994) and follow the steps to set up a git bash terminal. Open a new terminal to use ssh with your course specific account, if you get a questions asking yes or no, type yes, then enter your password.
