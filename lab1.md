## Remote Access - How to log into an account on ieng6

**Install Visual Studio Code**

Go to the website [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Follow all the steps to install onto your device. I didn't have to do this step as I already had VS code on my laptop. After it is installed, open it up. It should look something like this:

**Remote Connecting**
For Windows, the first step is to install [git](https://gitforwindows.org/), then, go to this [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42606837/how-do-i-use-bash-on-windows-from-the-visual-studio-code-integrated-terminal/50527994#50527994) and follow the steps to set up a git bash terminal. I skipped installing git because I already had it. Open a new terminal to use ssh with your course specific account, if you get a questions asking yes or no, type yes, then enter your password.

**Running some commands**
Use the terminal in VS code to run some commands. Some basic commands to run are:
* cd ~
* cd
* ls -lat
* ls -a
* ls

You can log out of the remote server by running the command exit.
