# Lab Report 4

## Step 4: Log into ieng6
The command to sign in was 5 up in the search history so I pressed the keys: `<up>` `<up>` `<up>` `<up>` `<up>` `<enter>` to sign in.

## Steps 5-7: clone, run tests, go into file to fix code
Since I had already done the commands to finish the lab tasks before, I ran the command, `fc -e true -12 -1` then I hit `<enter>` to run my previous 12 commands

from there the nano screen opened right into the spot where the error was so I pressed `<backspace>` and `2` to fix it. Then to save it I pressed `Ctrl-x`, `y`, and then `<enter>`.

## Steps 8-9: runs tests again, commit and push
After saving and exiting the rest of the commands continued running without me having to press anything. `cd ..` and `rm -rf lab7` were there because I would delete everything after I was done to prepare for another attempt.

I used [this](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/50381/re-run-multiple-history-commands) online answer to help me use the `fc` command.
